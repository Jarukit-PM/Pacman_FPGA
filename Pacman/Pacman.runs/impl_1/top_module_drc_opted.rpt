2. REPORT DETAILS

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 gameover_display_unit/sel has an input control pin gameover_display_unit/sel/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: gameover_display_unit/ADDRARDADDR[7]) which is driven by a register (vsync_unit/v_count_reg_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#2 Warning

REQP-1839#4 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 gameover_display_unit/sel has an input control pin gameover_display_unit/sel/ADDRARDADDR[4] (net: gameover_display_unit/ADDRARDADDR[0]) which is driven by a register (vsync_unit/h_count_reg_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 Stars_unit/sel has an input control pin Stars_unit/sel/ADDRARDADDR[8] (net: Stars_unit/ADDRARDADDR[0]) which is driven by a register (vsync_unit/v_count_reg_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset.
